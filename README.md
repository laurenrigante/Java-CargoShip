# cargoShip
 A Java program that simulates a cargoship. The user is presented with a menu of choices including starting a cargo ship and loading it with various types of packages. The point of this project was to implement inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling in efforts to further my knowledge on these topics.
 
 Inheritance and polymorphism was used to create packages of different types with different properties.
 Exception handling was used to ensure the user can only enter valid packages. The package entered must have a valid ID and weight.
